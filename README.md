# HW-Wireframe
homework 1
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to put the h1,h2,h3 and the p section inside of the article and section.
Probably took me longer than it should of but i realized i was nexting some of the elements inside the wrong ones is why
it didnt position propertly. The footer also gave me a hard time, it wouldnt respond to margin top like it should have.
